fix std during evaluation


try set initial stdev to higher
batchnorm: encourage exploration
2 layer: encourage exploration
3 layer use ent reg
std_fc: promising. entropy keeps rising
make critic learn 10x faster actor
use running mean for observation

Questions:
 * 3000 simulation step / 10 skipframe = 300 timestep
 * 4 layer
 * use var to directly output stdev?
 * how is std dev variable updated?
 * performance degrades. e.g. ppo_push_obj_rew_a100. perf works around 30th video. ~1 stdev
 * RNN?
