std_fc: output std as final layer of nn: entropy stays high around 8. doesn't work
no_vel_in_clamp: entropy decreases to -40
two layer: entropy increases slightly to 10
rnn: 2 layer not learning
ppo_push_obj_ent_reg0.001: promising. entropy decreased to ~4 at 90th video
batchnorm: entropy decreased to -40



Questions:
 * 3000 simulation step / 10 skipframe = 300 timestep
 * 4 layer
 * use var to directly output stdev?
 * how is std dev variable updated?
 * performance degrades. e.g. ppo_push_obj_rew_a100. perf works around 30th video. ~1 stdev
 *
 * RNN?
